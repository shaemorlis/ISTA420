1.	List the date/time types in T-SQL.
time	hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnn]
date	YYYY-MM-DD
smalldatetime	YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
datetime	YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.nnn]
datetime2	YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnn]
datetimeoffset	YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnn] [+|-]hh:mm
2. How do you express a date/time literal in T-SQL? 
datetime string literals are in single quotation marks (')
3.	What is the setting DATEFORMAT used for?
You can specify date data with a numeric month specified. For example, 5/20/97 represents the twentieth day of May 1997. When you use numeric date format, specify the month, day, and year in a string that uses slash marks (/), hyphens (-), or periods (.) as separators.
4. Write a T-SQL snippet changing the date format to German. Read the documentation on how to do
this.

5. What is the difference between CAST(), CONVERT(), and PARSE()? 
CAST- 1st argument, translated to the requested data type as provided by the 2nd argument.
CONVERT- 2nd argument, translated to the requested data type as provided by the 1st argument.
PARSE- Returns the result of an expression, translated to the requested data type in SQL Server. From string to date/time and number types only. 
6. What function returns the current date? This is very useful in a table that maintains a log of events,
such as user logins.
 The GETDATE() function returns the current database system date and time, in a 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. mmm' format.

7. How do you add one day to the current date? Add one week? Add one month? Add one year?
The DATEADD() function adds a time/date interval to a date and then returns the date.
SELECT DATEADD(year, 1, '2017/08/25') AS DateAdd;
SELECT DATEADD(week, 1, '2017/08/25') AS DateAdd;
SELECT DATEADD(month, 1, '2017/08/25') AS DateAdd; 
8. Write a SQL snippet to return the number of years between your birth date and today's date.
SELECT DATEDIFF(year, '1991/08/21', '2021/01/24') AS DateDiff;
9. How do you check a string literal to see if it represents a valid date? 
The ISDATE program determines whether a text expression represents a valid date. ISDATE only tests a text expression to see if it can be converted to a DATE-only value; it does not actually make the conversion. You must use CONVERT to make the conversion.
10. What does EOMONTH() do? Give an example of why this might be very useful.
The EOMONTH() function returns the last day of the month of a specified date, with an optional offset. The EOMONTH() function accepts two arguments: start_date is a date expression that evaluates to a date.
11. Payments are due exactly 30 days from the date of the last function. Write a select query that calculates the date of the next payment. Pretend we want to update a column in a database that contains the date of the next payment. We will do this when we write UPDATE queries.
SELECT DATEADD(day, 30, '2021/01/24') AS DateAdd;
12. Suppose your son or daughter wants to run a query every day that tells them the number of days until their 16th birthday. Write a select query that does this.
SELECT DATEDIFF (day, ‘today’s date’, ‘birthday date’)
