1. In your own words, what is a subquery? The SQL subquery is a SELECT query that is embedded in the main SELECT statement. 
2. In your own words, what is a self contained subquery? self-contained subqueries are independent of the outer query. the subquery is executed first, and the result is inserted into the WHERE clause of the outer query. 
3. In your own words, what is a correlated subquery? correlated subquery has a reference to an element from the table in the outer query. the OUTER query is executed first, and the subquery is executed for every row returned by the outer query.
4. Give an example of a subquery that returns a single value. When would you use this kind of subquery?
A subquery guaranteed to return a single value is known as a scalar subquery. Youre selecting records that are special relative to the group
SELECT orderid, orderdate, empid, custidFROM Sales.OrdersWHERE orderid = @maxid; 
5. Give an example of a subquery that returns multiple values. When would you use this kind of subquery? A multivalued subquery is a subquery that returns multiple values as a single column. Some predicates, such as the IN predicate, operate on a multivalued subquery. 
SELECT orderidFROM Sales.OrdersWHERE empid IN  (SELECT E.empid   FROM HR.Employees AS E   WHERE E.lastname LIKE N'D%'); 
6. Give an example of a subquery that returns table values. When would you use this kind of subquery? 
A table expression is a named query expression that represents a valid relational table. You can use table expressions in data-manipulation statements much like you use other tables. SELECT *FROM (SELECT custid, companyname      FROM Sales.Customers      WHERE country = N'USA') AS USACusts;
7. What does the exists predicate do? Give an example. The EXISTS predicate evaluates to TRUE providing the subquery contains any rows, otherwise it evaluates to FALSE. 
SELECT DISTINCT maker FROM Product AS Lap_product WHERE type = 'laptop' AND 
 EXISTS (SELECT maker FROM Product WHERE type = 'printer' AND maker = Lap_product.maker );
8. What happens if we use the not operator before a predicate? Give an example. NOT EXISTS works the same as EXISTS being satisfied if no rows are returnable by the subquery. The NOT operator negates the IN predicate; hence, the NOT TRUE becomes FALSE. 
SELECT custid, companyname FROM Sales.CustomersWHERE custid NOT IN(SELECT O.custid FROM Sales.Orders AS O);
9. When you use exists or not exists with respect to a row in a database, does it return two or three
values? Explain your answer. Two Values. For example, the following query returns customers from Spain who did not place orders:
SELECT custid, companynameFROM Sales.Customers AS C WHERE country = N'Spain'  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Sales.Orders AS O WHERE O.custid = C.custid);
10. How would you use a subquery to calculate aggregates? For example, you want to calculate yearly
sales of a product, and you also want to keep a running sum of total sales. Explain how you would use
a subquery to do this.
SELECT orderyear, qtyFROM Sales.OrderTotalsByYear;
